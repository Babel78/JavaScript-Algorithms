## Contribution Guide

#### First of all i am really glad that you want to contribute in this project.

1. First pick an issue that interests you and drop a comment to claim it (**if somebody has already commented on the issue and said that he/she will do that then look for some other issue**), then fork the repository and clone your forked repo to your local machine.

2. Now create a new branch on your local repo with the name of the algorithm you want to submit solution for, change your branch and run `npm install`.

3. Now open the file of the algorithm that you want to submit solution for and start writing your code in the function block (**do not change any other else in the file**).

4. After completing the solution run the tests for the specified algorithm to check whether your solution is right or not.

5. Once you have passed all the tests commit your solution file with the descriptive commit message like "Added name-of-the-algorithm".

6. Now create a pull request.

### Things to keep in mind:

- only change the algorithm file whose solution is not written, **do not change any other file**.
- **before submitting the pull request please make sure that your algorithm solution has passed all the tests**.
- one pull request for one algorithm.
- create pull request only for issues which are open and unclaimed.
- specify the issue number while submitting your pull request like `Closes #issueNumber`
- avoid spam pull requests.
